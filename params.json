In very early development, feel free to help out!\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-tal/fallingsky/gh-pages/images/demo.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nFirst, figure out how to get pygame installed on your platform in whatever interpreter you can. Then clone this repo and install it like a normal python package:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install fallingsky\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, if you want to grab the source to hack on it as well:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/a-tal/fallingsky.git\r\n$ cd fallingsky\r\n$ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will then have a `fallingsky` executable entry point in your `$PATH`.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\n\r\nEverything in The Tragedy of the Falling Sky is meant to be dynamic. This includes:\r\n\r\n* the screen resolution\r\n* the block size\r\n* maximum game board width & height\r\n* block drop/turn/move/hold/slam delays\r\n\r\nCurrently planning on adding game play elements to do with unlocking the ability to adjust these in game. If you want, you can hack around it by changing your user preferences or launching the game through the hack back door (see [main.py](https://github.com/a-tal/fallingsky/raw/master/fallingsky/main.py)).\r\n\r\nYour user preferences are stored in a platform specific/standard place. On Linux that is `~/.config/fallingsky`, on Mac it'd be `~/Library/Application Support/fallingsky` and on Windows, if this works, it'd save to `%HOMEDRIVE%\\\\%HOMEPATH%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\fallingsky`. Inside that folder is a list of JSON files for each user. If you wanted to cheat, adjust the values inside those files.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODOs\r\n=====\r\n\r\nObviously the \"artwork\" is a little rough around the edges. But that's not a super high concern right now, although if someone was to offer up a better color palette that could easily be implemented and would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nNeed to make a better UI for between games. Something to track progress better, maybe track each score as well instead of just total and best to show progress over time.\r\n\r\nDifferent maps. Shapes other than a rectangle. An interface for the user to select what height+width they want to use if doing arcade mode.\r\n\r\nSound effects. Background music.\r\n\r\nBetter backgrounds everywhere. Some pattern for arcade mode that painted the game board a bit better as well as the hold area and next area.\r\n\r\nAn interface to select how many next blocks you want. Next blocks in rows as well as columns. Some mechanism for earning more next blocks.\r\n\r\nBetter scoring. An interface to show how the difficulty of options you've selected has impacted the score modifier. Better display of points as the user scores them.\r\n\r\nExplosion animations.\r\n\r\nConfigurable controls.\r\n\r\nUI to configure the resolution and the block size.\r\n\r\nNetwork capabilities, PvP gameplay elements, AI for PvE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright and License\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThe Tragedy of the Falling Sky<br />\r\nCopyright (C) 2015 Adam Talsma.\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\r\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; version 2.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
